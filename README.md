Digit-Decoder
=============

The book, [Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close](http://www.worldcat.org/title/extremely-loud-incredibly-close/oclc/57319795) by Jonathan Safran Foer, contains a message typed entirely in phone digits. The message spans two and a half pages.

I am building this application as a tool to use to decode it. Also, I thought it would be a challenge from which I could learn some things.
